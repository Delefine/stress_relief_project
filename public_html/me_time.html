		<td>According to the University of Nevada Ren’s counseling services department, different speeds of music create different emotions. Faster music can make you feel alert and concentrate better. Upbeat music can make you feel more optimistic and  slower tempo can relax your muscles and make you  feel soothed.</td>
		<td>When feeling overwhelmed, messages and looking good can boost someone’s mood and confidence. The near hour experience can reduce the stress a person is experiencing due to the relaxed environment. Using products like eucalyptus and/or  peppermint epsom salt can add to the stress relief.</td>
		<td>Sometimes you just need to sit and watch your favorite shows. You do not need to be doing physical activities. When you are watching a show or a movie, your mind is more focused on the plot of the story that you tempary forget everything outside of the storyline.</td>
