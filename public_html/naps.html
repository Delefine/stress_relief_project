	<p>Naps are essential in relieving stress, especially if you have a hectic schedule. Power naps allow your body and brain to process and recover all the information absorbed throughout the time you were awake. Naps help to increase one's alertness, thinking, and performance. Taking a minimum of 30 to 90 minutes of a nap throughout the day will get you the boost of energy needed to keep you moving and relieve the tension in your body and load of emotions stored throughout. Start off by arranging the place you want to rest your body, comfy and relaxing. This can be done by making your bed or whatever surface you choose to lay your body on comfy and have nice smelling scents in the air to help you feel relaxed. Set a timer and put on relaxing soft background noise like rain fall or soothing piano noise to help relax your mind and body so you can relax.</p>
